## Description:
This application allows the user to view popular recipes, search for recipes based on a keyword such as "cookies", "pasta", or "vegan", or save their favorite recipes to be made again and again. Each search allows the user to view 10 recipes from the Edamam API. The generated recipes also come with the list of ingredients, nutritional information, estimated cost (provided by the Spoonacular API), an image, and a link to the preparation instructions.
